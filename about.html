                    <h3>Welcome to My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I am embarking on a transformative learning path exploring the rich tapestry of European Pagan traditions, with particular focus on Astrology and Sacred Geometry. This journey represents the beginning stages of understanding ancient wisdom systems that have guided humanity for millennia.</p>

                    <h3>My Path</h3>
                    <p>As a recent initiate into these profound studies, I approach this work with humility, curiosity, and deep respect for the traditions I'm learning. My focus areas include:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="focus-list">
                        <li><strong>European Pagan Astrology:</strong> Studying the celestial wisdom of ancient European cultures, understanding how our ancestors read the stars and planets to navigate life's journey.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sacred Geometry:</strong> Exploring the fundamental geometric patterns that underlie all of creation, from the spirals of galaxies to the structure of crystals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ritualism:</strong> Learning the ceremonial practices that connect us with natural cycles, seasonal changes, and cosmic rhythms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Celestial Cycles:</strong> Understanding lunar phases, solar movements, planetary transits, and their influence on earthly and spiritual matters.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>My Approach</h3>
                    <p>This space serves as a living documentation of my early-stage explorations. I believe in:</p>
                    <ul class="principles-list">
                        <li>Continuous learning and remaining open to new insights</li>
                        <li>Respecting ancient traditions while applying them to modern contexts</li>
                        <li>Sharing knowledge while acknowledging the depth yet to be discovered</li>
                        <li>Connecting with the natural world and its inherent patterns</li>
                        <li>Understanding that wisdom is a lifelong journey, not a destination</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why These Studies Matter</h3>
                    <p>In our modern world, we've become disconnected from the rhythms of nature and the cosmic patterns that our ancestors lived by. Through studying European Pagan traditions, astrology, and sacred geometry, I seek to:</p>
                    <ul class="purpose-list">
                        <li>Reconnect with ancestral wisdom and time-tested practices</li>
                        <li>Understand the mathematical and geometric principles underlying reality</li>
                        <li>Apply ancient knowledge to create harmony in contemporary spaces</li>
                        <li>Bridge the gap between spiritual insight and practical application</li>
                        <li>Honor the cyclical nature of existence and our place within it</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>A Note on My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I want to be transparent: I am at the beginning of this path. While I'm passionate and dedicated to these studies, I recognize that true mastery takes years of devoted practice. This website documents my learning process, resources I've found valuable, and insights gained along the way. I welcome connection with fellow seekers, experienced practitioners who might offer guidance, and anyone curious about these ancient wisdom traditions.</p>

                    <h3>Areas of Practical Application</h3>
                    <p>As I deepen my understanding of Sacred Geometry and cosmic principles, I'm particularly interested in their practical applications for:</p>
                    <ul class="application-list">
                        <li>Residential spaces - creating harmonious homes aligned with natural patterns</li>
                        <li>Workspace design - optimizing offices for productivity and well-being</li>
                        <li>Commercial buildings - applying geometric principles to public spaces</li>
                        <li>Land and plot planning - understanding the energetic properties of spaces</li>
                    </ul>
