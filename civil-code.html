                    <h3>What is the Cosmic Civil Code?</h3>
                    <p class="lead-text">The Cosmic Civil Code represents a spiritual framework for living in harmony with universal principles and natural law. Unlike human-made laws that vary by culture and time, cosmic law is eternal, unchanging, and woven into the fabric of existence itself.</p>
                    
                    <p>This code is not about rules imposed from outside, but about recognizing and aligning with the fundamental principles that govern all of creation - from the movement of stars to the beating of the human heart.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="foundational-principles">
                    <h3>Foundational Principles</h3>
                    
                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>🌌 The Law of Correspondence</h4>
                        <p><em>"As above, so below; as within, so without."</em></p>
                        <p>The patterns that exist in the macrocosm are reflected in the microcosm. The same forces that organize galaxies organize atoms. Understanding this principle allows us to see the divine order in all things and recognize ourselves as fractals of the whole.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>♻️ The Law of Reciprocity</h4>
                        <p><em>"What you put out into the universe returns to you."</em></p>
                        <p>Also known as karma or the law of cause and effect, this principle teaches that all actions have consequences that ripple through the web of existence. Acting with intention, integrity, and compassion creates positive ripples that return to their source.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>🔄 The Law of Cycles</h4>
                        <p><em>"All things move in rhythms and cycles."</em></p>
                        <p>From the seasons to the phases of the moon, from day and night to the cycles of civilizations, everything in existence moves in rhythmic patterns. Honoring these cycles - rather than resisting them - allows us to flow with life rather than against it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>⚖️ The Law of Balance</h4>
                        <p><em>"The universe seeks equilibrium."</em></p>
                        <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Extremes eventually return to center. Understanding this helps us navigate life's pendulum swings with wisdom, knowing that all states are temporary and balance will ultimately be restored.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>🌊 The Law of Vibration</h4>
                        <p><em>"Everything vibrates at its own frequency."</em></p>
                        <p>Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates. Thoughts, emotions, objects, and beings all emit frequencies. By consciously choosing our vibration - through thoughts, words, and actions - we can align with higher frequencies and attract corresponding experiences.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle-section">
                        <h4>🌱 The Law of Growth</h4>
                        <p><em>"Life seeks to expand, evolve, and express itself."</em></p>
                        <p>The universe has an inherent drive toward greater complexity, consciousness, and creativity. We honor this law by embracing personal growth, learning from challenges, and allowing ourselves to evolve rather than stagnate.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h3>Spiritual Governance vs. Human Law</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Cosmic Civil Code differs from conventional legal systems in fundamental ways:</p>

                            <h4>Internal vs. External</h4>
                            <p>Rather than external enforcement, cosmic law operates through natural consequences and inner knowing. The "punishment" for violating universal law is the natural result of being out of alignment.</p>

                            <h4>Unity vs. Separation</h4>
                            <p>Human law often creates divisions (legal vs. illegal, compliant vs. non-compliant). Cosmic law recognizes the interconnectedness of all beings and emphasizes that harming another ultimately harms oneself.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Eternal vs. Changeable</h4>
                            <p>While human laws shift with time, culture, and politics, cosmic law remains constant. Gravity doesn't change based on legislation, and neither do the fundamental principles of existence.</p>

                            <p>Following cosmic law is not about obedience to authority but about wisdom and understanding. It's recognizing what serves life and what diminishes it.</p>

                        <li><strong>Norse Philosophy:</strong> Understood the interconnectedness of all realms through Yggdrasil (World Tree) and the web of Wyrd (fate/destiny)</li>
                        <li><strong>Druidic Practices:</strong> Served as intermediaries between the natural and spirit worlds, maintaining balance and harmony</li>

                    <p>The Cosmic Civil Code is not a rigid set of commandments to be followed out of fear. It's a recognition of how reality actually functions. When you touch a hot stove, you get burned - not because fire is punishing you, but because that's the nature of fire.</p>
                    
                    <p>Similarly, when we act in ways that are out of alignment with cosmic principles - when we operate from separation rather than unity, from greed rather than reciprocity, from resistance rather than flow - we experience natural consequences.</p>
